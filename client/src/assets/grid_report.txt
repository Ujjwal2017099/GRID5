SUB PROBLEMS

Data Collection and Preparation

Gathering user data: Collecting information about users, such as their preferences, behaviors, demographics, and historical interactions
Collecting item data: Gathering details about the items in the system, such as attributes, categories, and metadata.
Data preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming raw data into a suitable format for modeling.

Recommendation Algorithms:

Collaborative filtering: Building models based on user-item interactions and leveraging similarities between users or items.
Content-based filtering: Recommending items based on user profiles and item attributes.
Hybrid approaches: Combining collaborative and content-based methods to improve recommendation quality.
Matrix factorization: use SVD algorithm for decomposing user-item interaction matrices to discover latent factors.
Deep learning models: Used ResNet50 to extract multiple features from images and used for similarity computation.

Cold Start Problem

provide the trending products based on CTR(Click Through Rate) score.
CTR = Clicks/Impressions * 100

Optimization

Tuning model parameters and hyperparameters to optimize recommendation performance.

Platform

Build an E-commerce website to help users in getting personalised recommendations based on their search history and product similarities
